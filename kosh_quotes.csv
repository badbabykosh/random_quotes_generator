,Dust to Dust,"And how have you chosen to honor that name? What is there left for Narn if all of creation falls around us? There is nothing. No hope, no dream, no future, no life. Unless we turn from the cycle of death toward something greater. If we are a dying people, then let us die with honor, by helping the others as no one else can. ",,,,,,
,Dust to Dust,"Because you have let them distract you. Blind you with hate. You cannot see the battle for what it is. We are fighting to save one another. We must realize we are not alone. We rise and fall together. And some of us must be sacrificed if all are to be saved. Because if you fail in this then none of us will be saved, and the Narn will be only a memory. [Vanishes.] You have the opportunity here and now to choose, to become something greater and nobler and more difficult than you have been before.

,Interludes and Examinations,"It's too late for me. I'm sorry for what I did before. I knew what was ahead. I guess -- I guess I was afraid. When you've lived as long as I have, you -- you get kinda used to it. Ah! [He shows more pain.] I wish I could have done more for you. There's so much I should have said, and now it's too late.
